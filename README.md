It was exciting to use Pascal's Triangle in an application :D <br><br>

Here T<sub>k</sub><sup>n</sup> is k<sup>th</sup> element in n<sup>th</sup> row of Pascal's Triangle...<br>
P is principal amount and I is interest p.a.<br>

Plus due to nature of drawn series, factorial calculation didnt require recursion, hence much efficient...
